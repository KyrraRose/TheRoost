##Welcome to The Roost!
###The Project
This is the README for my (Kyrra Bosland) second capstone project. This project is the point-of-sale application for my own custom shop. 
I decided to make a cafe inspired by one of my favorite games- Animal Crossing: New Horizons! In the game, a pigeon character named Brewster runs a cafe called the Roost.
Originally in the game, Brewster uses a coffee siphon to brew you a cup.. just for 200 bells!

###Running the Application
If you'd like to run it for yourself, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository
- Open the project in IntelliJ
- Build and run the main class
- Follow on-screen prompts

###Features
This application has a few capabilities as dictated by our capstone requirements and outlined here.
- Display options
- Customize drink orders
- Determine add-on food items
- Display and save a receipt

###Structure
For this project, I used a diagram to determine my class relationships:

Not diagrammed are:
- **OrderSystem:** Handles gathering drink information and updating the Receipt
- **MenuOptions:** Holds non-ingredient menu options and the functionality for displaying menu options

###Future Enhancements
In the future, I could add:
- Specialized drink recipes
- Drink adjustments post initial order
- Thread delays for smoother presentation
- Take a name for the order
- Allow for multiple orders
